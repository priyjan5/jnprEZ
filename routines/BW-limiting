Step 1) Configure a policer to limit the bandwidth to 1 mbps.

# set firewall policer policer-1mb if-exceeding bandwidth-limit 1m
# set firewall policer policer-1mb if-exceeding burst-size-limit 625000
# set firewall policer policer-1mb then discard 


Step 2) Configure another policer to limit the bandwidth to 9 mbps.

# set firewall policer policer-9mb if-exceeding bandwidth-limit 9m
# set firewall policer policer-9mb if-exceeding burst-size-limit 625000
# set firewall policer policer-9mb then discard 


Step 3) Configure a firewall filter with a term (term 0) that uses a policer (policer-1mb) to rate-limit traffic to 1 mbps for particular hosts.

# set firewall family inet filter output-limit term 0 from source-address 10.10.10.10/32
# set firewall family inet filter output-limit term 0 from source-address 10.10.10.11/32
# set firewall family inet filter output-limit term 0 then policer policer-1mb
# set firewall family inet filter output-limit term 0 then accept


Step 4) Configure another term (term 1) in the same filter to apply a policer (policer-9mb) to rate-limit traffic to 9 mbps for all other users.

# set firewall family inet filter output-limit term 1 from source-address 0.0.0.0/0
# set firewall family inet filter output-limit term 1 then policer policer-9mb
# set firewall family inet filter output-limit term 1 then accept 


Step 5) Apply the firewall filter to the logical interface.

# set interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 family inet filter input output-limit
# set interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 family inet filter output output-limit 


Notes

    To limit upload speed, apply the firewall filter to the "input" direction on the interface connected to the related network.

    To limit download speed, apply the firewall filter to the "output" direction on the interface connected to the related network.

    To rate-limit the traffic so that a specific percentage of available bandwidth can be used by a user/network, use the "bandwidth-percent" option:

     root@SRX# set firewall policer policer-1mb if-exceeding ?
     Possible completions:
        bandwidth-limit Bandwidth limit (32000..50000000000 bits per second)
        bandwidth-percent Bandwidth limit in percentage (1..100 percent)
